- a .xlsx file with geochemical data currently used in the Quarto document so that anyone can try the document
- a .html document which is the result of the rendering of the Quarto document
- a .pdf document showing that the results produced by this code is excatly similar to the results obtained with the CoDaPack software on the same data.
